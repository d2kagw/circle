            <li>Game setup:
              <ol>
                <li>Separate the character, state, goal and game cards</li>
                <li>Shuffle the goal and game cards</li>

            <li>A turn involves playing two cards from your hand. A play can be:
              <ul>
                <li>Play an event card by playing it on yourself, another player, or if it's a global event, you place it in one of two piles in the middle of the table. Global Events, or events played on other players take effect as soon as you've finished your turn.</li>
                <li>Play an item on yourself by placing it next to your character card. Or play the item on someone else, by placing it next to their character card and action any effects that might take place</li>
                <li>Put a card you don't want by putting it in the discard pile</li>
              </ul>
              You need to have 5 (or more) cards in your hand at the end of your turn, so draw the required number of cards from the draw pile at the end of your turn.
            </li>
            <li>If the draw pile is exhausted, shuffle the discard pile and keep going</li>
            <li>To win the game, you need to reach all of the goals outlined by your goal cards. Simply shout loudly and make a scene then force your friends to buy you a congratulatory beer</li>
